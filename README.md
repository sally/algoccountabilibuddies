## File Structure

Each folder is named after the month and year, and contains markdown files named after the date (in YYYYMMDD format) and daily problem (all lower case, snake case), which contain the problem statement, like such:

```
month-year
  | day-problem_title
```

e.g.

```
december-2016
  | 20161221-first_unique_character_in_string.md
  | 20161222-does_this_linked_list_have_a_cycle.md
  ...
january-2017
  | 20170101-invert_binary_tree.md
  ...
```

## Repo Usage

* Clone repo
* Find markdown file containing daily problem in appropriate monthly folder
* Complete problem in same folder in separate file, then create pull request

## Pull request protocol:

Make the title of your pull request as such:

> Name / Date / Problem Title

e.g.

> sally / 20161221 / first unique character in a string

## Problem Selection Rotation

* 20161221 - sally

rest TBD
