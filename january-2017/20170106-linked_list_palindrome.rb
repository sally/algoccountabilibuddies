# Given a singly linked list of integers, Your task is to complete a function that returns true if the given list is palindrome, else returns false.
#
# Input:
# The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T testcases follow. Each test case contains 2 line the first line contains an integer N denoting the size of the linked list. In the next line are N space separated values of the nodes of the linked list.
#
# Output:
# For each test case output will be 1 if the linked list is a pallindrome else 0.
