Given four digits, find the maximum valid time that can be displayed on a digital clock (in 24-hour format) using those digits. For example, given digits 1,8,3,2 the maxium valid time is "23:18".

Note that "28:31" is not a valid time.

Write a function that, given four integers A,B,C,D, returns the maximimum valid time in string format "HH:MM" or "NOT POSSIBLE" if it is not possible to display a valid time.

For example, given 1,8,3,2, the function should return "23:18".

Given 2,4,0,0 the function should return "20:40".

Given 3,0,7,0 the function should return "07:30".

Given 9,1,9,7 the function should return "NOT POSSIBLE".

Assume that A,B,C,D are integers within the range [0..9].

In your solution, focus on **correctness**. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
